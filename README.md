# What is this?

This is a basic bot for Hipchat.

It uses a basic [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) configuration to provide one option for quickly getting started with a basic setup using the following dependencies:

* Node.js 0.11.x
* Redis
* MongoDB
* ngrok
* nodemon
* a simple example addon

# How do I use it?

Just type

`/pick @alice @bob @foo`

and the bot will pick someone from the list.
